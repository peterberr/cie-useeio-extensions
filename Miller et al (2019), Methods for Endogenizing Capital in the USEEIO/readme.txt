The files included in this folder update those from 2018.  They use the US BEA's updated benchmark classification system.
These files are written in R; we recommend using RStudio.

Endogenize Capital in USEEIO v2.R is the main code, and refers to the final input files and final output files for 2007 and 2012.
The final intermed files are not referenced in the code, but were used to produce the .csv input files.

Endogenize Capital_Sodersten v2.R is the alternative code, adapting the approach developed by Sodersten et al. (2018).
This code references the final input files/2007_files/klems

The code and files correspond with:
