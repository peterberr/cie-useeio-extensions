# cie-useeio-extensions
A repository for ongoing work at Yale Center for Industrial Ecology with collaborators to make extensions to USEEIO.
Ongoing work includes engodenizing capital inputs to production, modifying the environmental satellite accounts to be relevant to more years and more sources of environmental impacts, and projecting detailed Make and Use tables to future years from the 2007 Benchmark tables from US BEA.
